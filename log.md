# Development Session Log

## Session 1: Repository Setup for Local & Codespaces Consistency
**Date:** 2025-09-17

### Initial Request
> "I want this repository to be flexible to both work on my machine but also work in github codespaces from a dependency standpoint. Can I set it up in a way for it to be consistent?"

### Key Decisions & Actions

#### 1. **Chose UV as Package Manager**
- User asked: "is it going to use UV in both?"
- Decision: Yes, UV for both environments due to speed and consistency
- UV is 10-100x faster than pip

#### 2. **Created Development Environment Structure**

**Files Created:**
- `pyproject.toml` - Updated with ML dependencies and optional groups (dev, ml-heavy)
- `.devcontainer/devcontainer.json` - GitHub Codespaces configuration
- `.devcontainer/setup-codespace.sh` - Auto-setup script for Codespaces
- `setup.sh` - Interactive local setup script
- `Makefile` - Consistent commands across environments
- `config/settings.py` - Resource detection and auto-configuration
- `.gitignore` - Updated with ML-specific exclusions
- `scripts/download_data.py` - Environment-aware data downloading
- `CLAUDE.md` - Project context documentation

#### 3. **Resource Management Strategy**
- Codespaces: Conservative settings (32 batch size, 2 workers, 10% data sampling)
- Local: Full resources (256 batch size, all CPUs, 100% data, GPU if available)
- Auto-detection via CODESPACES environment variable

#### 4. **Dependency Groups**
- **Base:** numpy, pandas, scikit-learn, matplotlib, jupyter
- **Dev:** pytest, black, ruff, ipdb
- **ML-Heavy (local only):** tensorflow, torch, xgboost, transformers

### Issues Encountered & Fixed

#### UV Installation Path Change
**Problem:** UV installer changed from `~/.cargo/env` to `~/.local/bin`
**Error in Codespace:**
```bash
./setup.sh: line 21: /home/codespace/.cargo/env: No such file or directory
```
**Solution:** Updated both setup scripts to:
- Export PATH with `$HOME/.local/bin`
- Check both locations for compatibility

### User Questions Answered

1. **"explain the scripts/download_data.py to me. what does that mean?"**
   - Explained it's a template for environment-aware dataset downloading
   - Auto-selects dataset size based on environment
   - Prevents Codespaces from downloading huge datasets

2. **"so how do I create the codespaces and get that set up"**
   - Provided step-by-step instructions
   - Explained auto-setup process
   - Covered pricing/limits (60 hours free/month)

3. **"can I update an existing codespace with the new changes we've made?"**
   - Explained three options: pull, rebuild container, full rebuild
   - Recommended container rebuild for devcontainer changes

### Final State
- Repository configured for dual environment support
- UV package manager working in both environments
- Resource detection implemented
- All setup scripts functional

### Next Steps Suggested
- Push changes to GitHub
- Test Codespace creation
- Add actual dataset URLs when available
- Update CLAUDE.md context for each session
